# pico-cs firmware

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/pico-cs/firmware)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/pico-cs/firmware)

pico-cs is a proof-of-concept for a model railway command station talking DCC (Digital Command Control) defined by the [NMRA DCC working group](https://www.nmra.org/dcc-working-group) and using the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) as DCC signal generator.

pico-cs is intended for skilled users with expert levels of model railway electronics and protocol knowledge.

## Why Raspberry Pi Pico

- Its support of programmable IO (PIO) enables implementing the core DCC protocol within a few lines of assembler code
- Due to its dual cores the DCC signal generation and the command interface are implemented using different cores being run in parallel
- Its small form factor and cost effectiveness allows and supports multiple command stations to be used as part of the model railroad layout
- Its great ducumentation 
- And last but not least the fun using it

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W
- A PC, Laptop, Raspberry Pi or any suitable device with an USB interface to flash the firmware and operate the command station via serial over USB
- A model railway booster
- A model railroad locomotive roller test stand
- A DCC decoder equiped test locomotive

### Booster

As there is a lot of booster alternatives (motor shield, H-bridge, commercial booster, ...) the selection and connection options to the Pico goes beyond the scope of this document. You might find potential solutions searching the internet.

Voltage levels:
- Pico DCC signal output is on GP2 with 3.3V level
- As most digital booster DCC inputs would not work with 3.3V (please consult booster documentation) one need to choose a safe and reliable solution for level conversion

### DCC decoder

Please be aware that not all DCC decoders do support all of the DCC commands. The pico-cs command station is using the DCC commands which most standard compliant DCC decoders should be able to understand. Nonetheless some decoders 
- do have issues with main track programming
- do behave wierd in case functions are used not supported by the decoder or writing CVs in general

**Please be cautious and test all loco decoders on a roller test stand before using on track.**

To mitigate some of the function setting issues the pico-cs command station is only refreshing functions which were explicitly used via the protocol.

## Quick Start

- Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your PC via an USB cable
- Download the latest UF2 pico-cs firmware [cs.uf2](https://github.com/pico-cs/firmware/releases)
- Install cs.uf2 to the Raspberry Pi Pico via BOOTSEL mode (see [Raspberry Pi Pico documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html))
- Use a terminal emulation tool supporting serial over USB communication like the Serial Monotor of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Set the baud rate to 115200 and \<CR\> (Carriage Return) as command / message ending character
- Raspberry Pi Pico DCC signal output is on GP2

## Build

To build the firmware the Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK and toolchain needs to be installed. For details please consult the [Raspberry Pi Pico documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html).


## Protocol

Please see [protocol](protocol.md) for information about the implemented text protocol.

## Features

- Pico firmware implementing DCC comands to control model railway locomotives
- Simple command human readable and debug friendly text protocol
  - which can be used directly via serial terminal programs supporting serial over USB
  - and easily integrated into any programming language or tool supporting serial over USB communication
- [client library](https://github.com/pico-cs/go-client) written in [Go](https://go.dev/)

## Outlook

- Pico W network connection
